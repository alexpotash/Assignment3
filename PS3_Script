## Question 1

import os # For setting working directory
import string # For splitting lines

# The following line of code only works on my computer because it sets the working directory
os.chdir("/Users/alexpotash/GradSchool/Classes/PhD/Fall2018/Programming/Class_Files-master/data/") 

fhand=open('CO-OPS__8729108__wl.csv') # Read csv file
data = fhand.read().splitlines(True) # Breakdown the data by line
data2=(data[1:]) # Remove the column headings

t=list() # Create an empty list to receive the date & time and the water level

for line in data2:
    line = line.rstrip() 
    x=(line[0:16]) # Characters that correspond with date and time
    y=(line[17:22]) # Characters that correspond with the water level
    z=[y,x] 
    t.append(z) # Add the date & time and water level to a list
    
max(t) # Find the max water level



## Question 2

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('CO-OPS__8729108__wl.csv') # Read the csv file using pandas
maxindex=df[' Water Level'].idxmax() # Find the index (row #) of the max value in the 'Water Level' column
df.iloc[[maxindex]] # Report the line of the dataframe that contains the max water level


## Question 3

df = pd.read_csv('CO-OPS__8729108__wl.csv')
water=df[' Water Level']

waterdiff=water.diff(periods=1) # Use the .diff command to calculate the difference between successive rows (periods=1)
print(max(waterdiff.dropna())) # Report the maximum value of difference between successive water values and drop the NA value


## Question 4

# Need to include the following line to make plot appear in Jupyter Notebook
%matplotlib inline 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv('CO-OPS__8729108__wl.csv')

plt.plot(df["Date Time"],df[" Water Level"]) # Plot the date and time on the X axis and plot the water level on the Y axis
plt.xlabel('Date') 
plt.ylabel('Water Level')
plt.show() # This takes about 30 seconds for the plot to appear. Be patient.
